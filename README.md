# AWS Data Engineer Associate certification

I scored 1000/1000 on the [AWS Data Engineer - Associate exam](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-data-engineer-associate/). I hope my materials and cheat sheets help you!

## What I did for the preparation:

1. Completed [FREE AWS Certified Data Engineer Associate Practice Exam – Sampler](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/free-aws-certified-data-engineer-associate-practice-exam-sampler/)
2. Took [Planning Large Scale Data Migrations to AWS](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/15545/) (for personal interest)
3. Reviewed all questions from [Examtopics](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/amazon/aws-certified-data-engineer-associate-dea-c01/)
4. Checked some concepts hands-on in my [AWS Management console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)

**(Disclaimer)**: I already had experience with core Data Engineering services (Redshift, Athena, Glue, Kinesis, S3) + the Data Analytics Specialty certification ([retired](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/aws-certification-retirements-and-launches/)) + knowledge of [Architecting on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/training/classroom/architecting-on-aws/) + [AWS Solutions Architect associate certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/).
